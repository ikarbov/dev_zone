The [Wine & Cheese app](http://www.wineandcheesemap.com/) is an example app built using a Cytoscape.js visualisation.  It allows the user to explore [wine and cheese pairings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_and_food_matching) interactively.

The app features a good example of how to leverage Cytoscape.js to add relevant interactivity to a graph visualisation:  The user can click a wine or cheese of interest and the graph animated and reorganises itself to highlight the pairings with the chosen item.

The app is mobile compatible, and it serves as a good reference for how to structure a modern single page application.  The source code for the app is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/cytoscape/wineandcheesemap) under the MIT license.  Feel free to use the source code as a general reference or as a starting point to build an app with Cytoscape.js.

Thank you for using Cytoscape.js.

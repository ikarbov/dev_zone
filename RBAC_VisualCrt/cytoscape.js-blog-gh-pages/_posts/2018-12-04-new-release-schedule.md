After the release of version 3.3.0 of Cytoscape.js, the project will use a new release schedule:  For patch versions (e.g. 3.0.0 to 3.0.1), a new release will be made at the beginning of a week if any bug fixes were made in the previous week.  For minor versions (e.g. 3.3 to 3.4), a release will be made at the beginning of a month if any new features or enhancements have been made in the previous month.

This schedule may result in minor releases with less new things in them, but it will mean that new features will be available sooner.

Thank you for using Cytoscape.js!
